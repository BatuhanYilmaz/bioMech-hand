# bioMech-hand

This project is about building a fully operating prosthetic hand from scratch. The aim of this project is to encourage maker movement, in the sense of creating affordable hand prosthetics solution for disabled people.

The hand can be built with:

- x1 Arduino Nano
- x5 MG90s/SG90 micro servos
- Some buttons, resistors and jumpers
- Some 3D printing material, rubber bands and fish line
- A little enthusiasm


## Design

For the ease of assembly, the design is kept as simple as possible. In the design folder, there are 7 types of parts and 20 parts in total for building a full hand.

## Code

To keep it simple, an Arduino Nano is used for controlling the finger movements. One can utilize other types of Arduino, or program the hand with the help of a desired board.
